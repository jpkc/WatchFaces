# Watch Faces
Watch Faces for SmartWatches in hope of a happy and colorful future for kids who are currently locked down for a greater good.

# History
Its 2021. Pandemics still holding us back and... My 5 years old kid asked me for a Ben10 watch. For those who are not familiar with it Ben10 is a cartoon about Ben, a 10 years old boy, who finds a watch that can turn him into aliens. The watch is called Omnitrix.

Turns out that the branded Omnitrix watch is a stupid toy made out of cheap plastic which makes some really annoying noises and costs about 30â‚¬. **I refuse to support that kind o industry**.

Today's smartwatches costs about the same and are way more interesting than those noisy plastic crap, so... Why not make my kid a proper Omnitrix?

Looking online I found the Haylou Solar HL05 SmartWatch. It is round as the omnitrix, has a clean design, is IP68 rated (Waterproof to 1.5m for at most 30 minutes) and the battery lasts for 30 days in one charge.

There is also a tool to create watchfaces for it (https://hswt.tilda.ws/) - the perfect candidate, with plenty colorful afordable wristbands available.

Even if it breaks shortly it will still deliver more that the plastic contender will ever be able to.

And since I am doing it, why not publish it? That way I might even make some other kids happy as well. :-)

# Specs and Flavours
Trying to get most of my target audience happy I designed 5 watchface flavours. Each one matches the cartoon somehow. Apart from the cartoonish design, they all have the following specs:

- All flavours have both analog and digital displays with a discreet hour, minute and second hands on the outer rings.

- The background goes red when battery is about to end - just like it happens with the Omnitrix runs out op power and an alien transformation is about to end.

- Weekdays and weekends have different colors.

- Months have colors according to season. (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)

I added two variants for each flavour so that North and South Hemisphere months and color codes properly match.

# The Artwork
I have prepared the artwork in high resolution (2048x2048 images) and tuned it for the chosen watch (240x240). But here I also added the full resolution images ins case someone wants to port it to some other watchwatch.
